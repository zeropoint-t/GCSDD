<h1>Assignment 2: Sleeping Barbers</h1>

<p>
  Original author: Munehiro Fukuda

</p>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
  The Sleeping Barbers problem is a "toy problem" that illustrates
  some of the complexities of concurrency.  The scene is a barber shop
  with one or more barbers and zero or more chairs in the waiting
  area.  The barbers sleep in their chairs until a customer arrives to
  wake up one of the barbers.
</p>

<p>
  The awoken barber cuts the customer's hair.  Meanwhile other
  customers may arrive.  If all the barbers are busy and there's an
  available chair in the waiting room, the arriving customer takes
  a number and sits in one of the waiting-room chairs.
</p>

<p>
  If all the chairs are full, an arriving customer just leaves without
  taking a number.
</p>

<p>
  When a barber finishes with the customer, the customer gives the
  barber payment and the barber collects the payment.  The customer
  leaves satisfied.  The barber then services the next customer if one
  is waiting.  Otherwise, the barber goes back to sleep in his or her
  chair.
</p>

<p>
  At the end of the simulation, the shop closes.  No new customers
  arrive, but the barbers will continue to provide service to any
  waiting customers, until the last customer leaves and all the
  barbers have gone back to sleep.
</p>

<p>
  You will write a C++ program using pthreads that simulates the
  Sleeping Barbers problem.  The program will take six parameters in
  its argument vector: number of barbers, numbers of chairs in the
  waiting room, barber's average service time
  (in
  milliseconds<a name="text_1"></a><a href="http://courses.washington.edu/css503/2019q2/assignments/assignment-02/assignment-02.html#footnote_1" class="footnote_link"><sup class="footnote">1</sup></a>),
  standard deviation in service time,
  average customer arrival interval,
  and duration of the simulation (seconds).
</p>

<p>
  Since there are so many parameters, you may find this
  <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/css503/2019q2/assignments/assignment-02/RUN" target="_blank">RUN</a>
  script more readable for invoking the barbers program.
</p>

<p>
  Run the simulation for 5 minutes with average service time of 1200
  milliseconds and standard deviation of 200ms.  Assuming there are 3
  barbers and customers arrive on average every 400ms, determine
  approximately how many waiting-room chairs are required to avoid
  turning away customers.
</p>

<p>
  The actors in the system are the
  <code>Shop</code>,
  the
  <code>Barber</code>s,
  and the
  <code>Customer</code>s,.
  The
  <code>Barber</code>s
  and the
  <code>Shop</code>
  persist for the duration of the simulation.
  The
  <code>Customer</code>s
  are
  <em>ephemeral</em>.
</p>

<p>
  The actors will print messages to trace events
  during the simulation.
</p>

</ul>


<h2>Actors</h2>

<p>
  While the solution will be implemented in C++ using the pthreads
  library, the concept of actors can simplify modeling.
</p>

<p>
  The essential idea is that actors are objects on steroids.  Each
  instance corresponds to a separate thread and does whatever it does
  concurrently with other actors.  Actors communicate by sending
  <em>messages</em>
  to each other.
</p>

<p>
  For each kind of actor, create a C++ class that has a
  <code>run</code>
  method.  The thread will call
  <code>run</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Messages will be simulated by having all other methods called from
  other threads. The method bodies will apply any necessary low-level
  concurrency control and set member variables in the object that the
  running thread will pick up.
</p>


<h2>Class Design</h2>

<p>
  The
  <code>Shop</code>
  class should hold global state, including the list of sleeping
  barbers and the queue of waiting customers (at all times, at least
  one of these lists should be empty).
  The action of the shop will be to instantiate customers at random
  intervals.
</p>

<p>
  The customer should check the shop for a sleeping barber or empty
  chair.
  This needs to be an atomic operation because we don't want a race
  condition between the barber finishing with a prior customer and
  going back to sleep, while the customer sees the barber is busy and
  takes a seat in the waiting room.
  The
  <code>Shop</code>
  should hold the mutex controling the customer's selection of barber
  or waiting-room chair.
</p>

<p>
  A skeleton program
  <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/css503/2019q2/assignments/assignment-02/barbers-skel.cc" target="_blank">barbers-skel.cc</a>
  has been provided.  Use it, or don't use it as you see fit.
</p>


<h2>Notes &amp; Hints</h2>

<p>
  When the shop closes, no new customers arrive, but the barbers will
  continue service until there are no more waiting customers.
</p>

<p>
  Use
  <code>std::normal_distribution</code>
  to compute the barber's service time for each customer.  Clip the
  minimum service time to 80% of the barber's average service time.
</p>

<p>
  Use
  <code>std::poisson_distribution</code>
  to compute the arrivals of customers.
</p>

<p>
  The program will be creating short-lived customer threads, so it's
  important not to leak resources.  One way is to add a
  <code>Reaper</code>
  or
  <code>Undertaker</code>
  actor that receives messages from expiring
  <code>Customer</code>
  threads.
  Alternatively, you can fold that functionality into the
  <code>Shop</code>
  thread.
</p>

<p>
  A third, simpler way is to create the customer threads in detached
  mode and have the thread start function delete the actor.
</p>

<div class="codebox"><code><pre>class Actor{/*...*/};

void run(void *arg) {
  Actor *actor = reinterpret_cast&lt;Actor *&gt;(arg);
  actor-&gt;run();
  delete actor;
  return nullptr;
}


main() {
  // Create thread in detached mode.
}
</pre></code></div>

<p>
  Use
  <code>usleep</code>
  for microsecond-level pauses to simulate thread activity
  (i.e. barber cutting hair).  It's often helpful to include units in
  the variable name, so you don't get confused between seconds,
  milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds.
</p>

<p>
  The entire program is small enough to fit into a single source
  file, but you may prefer dividing it among several files.  Either
  way will be acceptable.
</p>

<p>
  Don't forget to include your recommendation for waiting-room size in
  the README file.
