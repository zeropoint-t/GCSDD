Barbers and the remote file system using RPC has great resemblances in that barbers used wait & signal and RPC used sento & recvfrom.
As I started exploring more similarities between these 2 approaches, I came to understand that condition variables/signal c
ombinations in the barbers problem are just like sendto/scoket desctiptors as well. I feel that I can implement the barbers solution, 
now using RPC/socket we practiced in assignment 4.

I would modify the server in a few ways. One would be to spawn a new thread for each client connection as soon as the request comes in
and the server goes back to the listen mode right way. Another modification would be to make it stateless
and let the client handle the bookkeeping of the states. That way, a server can handle and proceed
where it left off without mainining states.

This course has been an eye opening for me personally and have never been so intellectually challenged before.

Thank you for sharing your knowledge in such a manner that really taught me what I wanted to learn
I am confident this will benefit me in my futrue carrer for years to come.

Thanks again and hope to see you again soon,

Tetsuya
