<h1>Assignment 4: Remote Procedure Calls</h1>

<p>
  The
  <em>Remote Procedure Call</em>
  abstraction hides the complexity of communicating between a client
  and server in a distributed application.
</p>

<p>
  The objective is to make it look, as closely as possible, as if the
  client application is simply calling an ordinary function in its own
  process space.
  Unfortunately, it is an imperfect ("leaky") abstraction because the client
  code must deal with the multiple failure modes that may occur in a
  distributed system.
</p>

<p>
  RPCs consists of three parts.  A client-side library of function
  defining the application-program interface, a
  serialization/communication protocol and support library, and a
  server-side set of handler functions.
</p>

<p>
  Software development kits for implmenting RPCs typically include a
  <em>Domain-Specific Language</em>
  allowing the developer to describe the function parameters.
  These DSLs are typically known as
  <em>Data Definition Languages</em>.
</p>

<p>
  The DDL takes a description of a function's arguments and return
  values (in effect, a function declaration), and generates source
  code for the client and source-code stubs for the server.
</p>

<p>
  The client-side functions simply marshal their arguments and pass
  them to a communication layer that transmits the arguments to the
  server and unmarshalls the result returned from the server.  The
  communication layer can be a pre-compiled library that is linked
  into the client program.
</p>

<p>
  The programmer writing the server (possibly but not necessarily the
  same person responsible for writing the client-side application)
  fills in the server-side stubs with the business logic for the
  particular service.
</p>

<p>
  The original RPC mechanism, now called
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Network_Computing_Remote_Procedure_Call" target="_blank"> ONC-RPC</a>,
  was developed by Sun Microsystems as part of their Network File
  System (NFS) project to create the original fileshare. NFS was
  implemented partially in the kernel, so an NFS volume could be
  mounted as if it were an ordinary filesystem.
</p>

<p>
  With that for inspiration, your task is to implement a scaled-down
  userland version of a network filesystem.  You will
  <em>hand-roll</em>
  the
  service, defining the data exchange and making the necessary system
  calls to exchange the data.  Do not use an RPC utility.
</p>

<p></p>
  For the purposes of the assignment, don't worry about data
  compression or encryption.
<p></p>

<p>
  Simulate authentication (you are who you say you are) &amp;
  authorization (you have the permission to do what you are asking)
  using a 64-bit number as an "auth" token.
  Normally, this would be provided by an credentialing service or
  through some other suitable mechanism, but you may use
  <code>getrandom(2)</code>
  to generate a random number.
</p>

<p>
  Use UDP to exchange information.
  Since UDP is "unreliable", each request to the server should include
  the auth token and a second 64-bit randomly-generated sequence
  number.  Any response from the server should include the sequence
  number to indicate which client request the server is responding
  to.
</p>

<p>
  The client should maintain a timeout on each request it makes to the
  server.  The client library may retry once after a timeout.  If the second
  request fails or fails to return any result, the client should
  report failure (via the return value) to the application.
</p>

<p>
  To avoid dealing with concurrency, you may assume the server handles
  only a single request at a time.  Multiple concurrent requrests will
  get queued up in the socket's listen queue.
</p>

<p>
  You may start with this skeleton for the client side:
  <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/css503/2019q2/assignments/assignment-04/RemoteFileSystem-skel.h" target="_blank">RemoteFileSystem-skel.h</a> 
</p>

<p>
  In your
  <code>README</code>,
  include a paragraph or two comparing the RPC and message-passing
  concurrency abstractions (as implemented in this assignment and your
  Sleeping Barbers solution).
  Also include a brief discussion of how you would modify your server
  and client library to handle concurrent requests.
</p>

<p>
  Don't forget the
  <code>BUILD</code>
  script.
